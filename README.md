Here is an animated visualization of iterating linear functions as described in chapter 6 of David P. Feldman's "Chaos and Fractals".

F(x)= mx + b

In this visualization I am showing the four main types of fixed points:
- repelling or unstable where m > 1
- attracting or stable  m => 0 and m < 1
- attracting or stable with oscillations m > -1 and m < 0
- repelling or unstable with oscillations m < -1
